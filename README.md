# NETProInnovations-Foundations
This repository is for my blog NETPro Innovations. All the exercises in the series will be featured here. 

Here is the code from the post [Introduction to Programming in C# â€“ The Hands-on Approach](https://www.netproinnovations.com/2023/07/04/introduction-to-programming-in-c-the-hands-on-approach/) which covers how to install Visual Studio 2022 - Community Edition and goes over how to set up and run your first C# program.
